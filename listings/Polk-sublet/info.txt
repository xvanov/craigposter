The Polk Community is a co-living community that is conveniently right next to the Illinois Medical District, a neighborhood filled with cheap eats, cozy coffee shops, and great bars. The house is a convenient 12-minute walk away from the Western  Blue Line train station which takes you directly intro UIC in 5 minutes, downtown in less than 20 minutes, or directly to O'Hare Airport.

You'll have your own private bedroom which is fully furnished with a bed, desk and everything you'll need - just bring your suitcase! There are one shared bathrooms and laundry machines you can use for free. The kitchen and living room are all community spaces where roommates study, watch movies, and hang out together. The backyard has a seating area, string lights, and a fire pit perfect for making delicious s' mores during the summer.

All shared living spaces are fully furnished and professionally cleaned twice a week by a housekeeper. All utilities are included in your rent. The kitchen is fully stocked with all the basic supplies you'll need to cook. There are many options to buy groceries within walking distance from the house or you can have your groceries delivered.

<i>"Living at SubletInn after moving to Chicago was hands-down the best choice I made. The neighborhood location is great and the house is close to the train. SubletInn made it easy to make friends and meet people in a new city, and the community at the house was incredible."</i> - Dante

<i>"I stayed at SubletInn over the summer while doing an internship in Chicago and had by far the best experience I could have imagined. The House was full of life from all of its members, and provided me with a great community after coming in never having been to Chicago."</i> - Eli

<i>"I met extremely interesting people from all over the world and I felt I was a part of a family since day 1. Polk offered me a perfect mix of fun and privacy to study or work while in the house. I loved it!"</i> - Angeliki
